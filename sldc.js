// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Requirements
// design
// Development
// Test
// Deployment
// maintenance


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const design = "this is the second step, in which the goal is to come up with a fully functioning, ideally flawless design."
const Development = ("The third step in the SLDC process, where the goal is to develop the software, and have it working according to design.")
const test = ("the fourth step, in which the software is rigorously tested and checked for bugs.")
const deployment = (" The fifth step, where the software is actually deployed, to be used by anyone avaliable to get access to it.")
const maintenance = ("The last step in the SLDC process, where maintenance and upkeep must be done on the softare, to make it better over time, making it more appealing to the users.")
